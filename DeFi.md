A Shard in a blockchain
- Sharding is a database partitioning technique being considered by blockchain networks and being tested by Ethereum.1
- The more users that blockchain networks take on, the slower the network becomes, leading to significant latency.
- Sharding can improve network latency by splitting a blockchain network into separate shardsâ€”each with its own data, separate from other shards.1

- Security concerns surrounding sharding include a hack or shard takeover, where one shard attacks another, resulting in a loss of information.
